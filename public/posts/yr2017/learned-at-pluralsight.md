I've learned quite a bit in the last two years working at [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/). I wanted to capture at a high level many of the things that I've learned. I could write an entire post about each of these items, but I doubt I'll ever have time for that, so I want to at least capture the learnings at a high level.

## Practices

- My understanding of TDD has deepended. I actually did get [a post written about TDD](/posts/yr2017/details-on-tdd).
- When to be WET (Write Everything Twice) and when to be [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) (yes, there are actually times when it is better to be WET than DRY -- too much abstraction can be a bad thing).
- Feature Toggles vs. Feature Branches
- Pair programming / mob programming
- Pull requests
- Lean
- Kanban
- [Retrospectives](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile-retrospectives-as-a-tool-for-team-learning/)
- [REST apis](http://www.restapitutorial.com/) and several standards, e.g. [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/)
- [12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/)

## Architecture
- Asynchronous messaging architecture. There's a ton written about this; [this article](https://www.infoq.com/articles/integration-mistakes) has some good info.
- Application architecture patterns
    - Presentation / Application / Domain
    - Feature Based

## Technologies

- Node.js
- React.js
- CSS modules
- npm
- PostgreSQL
- Cassandra

## Design Patterns

- [Builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern)
- [Mother pattern](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html)
- [Facade pattern](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/facade_pattern.htm)

## Learning Resources

- Massive reading list. Many of my colleagues at Pluralsight are extremely well read. The list of book recommendations I have received from them is enormous; it will take me years and years to get through the reading list I have accumulated.
