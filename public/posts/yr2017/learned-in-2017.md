As I'm constantly learning new things, I have found that many of the things I have learned either don't merit a post on their own, another post has already been written and I don't have anything to add beyond what has already been said, or I just don't have time to write a whole post on a given subject. So it's nice to have a collection of ideas. So I came up with the idea to create a summary post that can serve as a bin of sorts. A year seems like a reasonable amount of time in which to bin things, at least for right now. Perhaps I'll modify the structure in the future.
