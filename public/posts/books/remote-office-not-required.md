I've been wanting to work remotely for years and now I finally am! I'm really excited to be working remotely from home. In preparation for my first stab at full-time remote work, I read what might be the most popular book on working remotely: Remote.

I was a bit disappointed in the depth of the book - it seemed to me that the authors never really went deep. Perhaps my perspective is just a reflection of the fact that for several years I've been talking to people who have or are working remotely, so this book in the end did not contain much new information for me. A fair amount of the book was spent making the case for remote work, so perhaps that was another part of the reason why I didn't get the depth I was expecting.

I think I can sum this book up pretty accurately with a bulleted list. There are details about each of these ideas in the book.
