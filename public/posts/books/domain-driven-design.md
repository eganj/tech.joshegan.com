## Terms

One of the goals of Domain-Driven Design is to provide "a technical vocabulary for discussing domain design" [xix]. Well, given the vocabulary, it's useful to know what the words mean.

Term | Definitions
--- | ---
Domain | a sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity
Ubiquitous | existing or being everywhere at the same time

## Ubiquitous Language

> The geatest value of a domain model is that it provides a ubiquitous language that ties domain experts and technologists together. [Foreward]

One of the core ideas discussed repeatedly in this book is that engineers need to be close to subject matter experts and they need to be able to communicate clearly with each other. The ability of an engineering project to succeed is directly related to the engineer's ability to understand the problem domain and create an appropriate model to represent the domain.
