And by &#39;attended&#39; I mean I logged into the site that hosted the virtual conference and watched the sessions on demand a couple weeks after the event actually took place. I&#39;ve been watching at a comfortable pace for myself, a few sessions in a sitting. I&#39;ve also watched sessions that took place simultaneously. There are pros and cons to the virtual world. Watching all the sessions I&#39;m interested in on my own time regardless of session collisions -- definitely a plus.</p>
<p>In an effort to better digest what I hear, I take notes. In an attempt to organize my thoughts, I write. So these are some of my thoughts and reflections from the OnAgile Virtual Conference.</p>
<h1>You Can&#39;t be Agile When You&#39;re Waist Deep in Mud!</h1><p>Presented by Martin Fowler and Rachel Laycock, this keynote emphasized following technical practices to ensure that you can really stay agile. This presentation was more of a summary of practices, rather than a deep exploration of any one of them. Here are some of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>&#39;Already Agile&#39;</li>
<li>Better Automation</li>
<li>Treat infrastructure as Code</li>
<li>In order to actually be agile, a lot of the desirable benefits come back to the code. Successful CI requires a good code base.</li>
<li>Many projects get stuck at the &#39;1 star&#39; level.</li>
<li>Only about 30% (or less) are using agile technical practices</li>
<li>One of the core goals is short cycles and rapid iterations</li>
<li>Scrum&#39;s approach says that you <em>should</em> have technical practices, but those practices are not defined.</li>
<li>XP&#39;s approach says that you should use <em>these</em> practies.</li>
<li>Key agile practices include TDD, CI, sustainable pace, pair programming</li>
<li>Goal is to create software that is releasable as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Self testing code</li>
<li>TDD is the process by which the tests are created.</li>
<li>is TDD dead (a video that was referenced)</li>
<li>In order to understand when tests are useful and when they aren&#39;t, you have to have a mature understanding of how to do TDD. There are cases, for example when doing a quick exercise to determine feasibility, when tests may not be useful.</li>
<li>code ownership</li>
<li>&quot;my&quot; code and &quot;his&quot; code are terms that should be avoided. The code should belong to the team. This is addressed by pair programming.</li>
<li>Continuous integration requires a test suite that conveys confidence in the functionality of the code.</li>
<li>Always be looking for quick feedback cycles.</li>
<li>The feedback cycle needs to be fast enought to satiate individual tolerance.</li>
<li>Refactoring</li>
<li><a href="include link to amazon here.">The book by Martin Fowler about refactoring</a></li>
<li>The point of refactoring is to make changes to the internal structure of the code without changing its external behavior.</li>
<li>Take very very small steps, so small they don&#39;t seem worth taking. This makes it much more difficult to introduce a bug. It also makes it so that you can catch a breaking change immediately.</li>
<li>You should not be &#39;refactoring&#39; and have a bunch of broken tests.</li>
<li>If you have to take time to understand code, and then you get it, at that point you should refactor and make the code clear.</li>
<li>Collective code ownership facilitates refactoring. That way, when you see a problem, you can improve it.</li>
<li>When prioritizing refactoring, you need to think about it upfront. How complex is the task, and how complex is the code base that you&#39;ll be working in?</li>
<li>One idea is to create a technical debt backlog wall. Then work items into the daily work.</li>
<li><p>When deciding whether or not to refactor you should consider these three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What bits are complex?</li>
<li>What is the level of test coverage? How confident can you be when you make changes?</li>
<li>Where is the business going?</li>
<li>How often is it changing?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>As soon as you set up quality code / speed of features, you&#39;re hosed. You simply cannot deliver quickly in the long term without a quality code base.</p>
</li>
<li>You must ensure that you keep the code base healthy so that you can maintain speed.</li>
<li><p>Continuous integration</p>
<ul>
<li>Commit to master all the time.</li>
<li>Staying on feature branches, even if builds are automated, is not CI.</li>
<li><p>CI is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commit onto trunk.</li>
<li>Commit at least once / day.</li>
<li>Committing and running the tests.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>CI has been confused with CD (Continuous Delivery)</p>
</li>
<li>Merge pain is a sign that you&#39;re not integrating frequently enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>DevOps is a cultural movement, not a team.</p>
</li>
<li>DevOps is an attempt to overcome the antagonistic relationship between ops and devs, whose goals can often differ.</li>
<li>Creating a &#39;devops&#39; team can cause even more problems.</li>
<li>DevOps is a culture of developers and operations working together.</li>
<li>The most common architecture structure is a ball of mud.</li>
<li>The problem is that the design evolves over time, and the ball of mud is thus created.</li>
<li>Requires discipline.</li>
<li>The best way to address a ball of mud is to not create it in the first place.</li>
<li>Technical practices are at the core of being able to implement Agile effectively.</li>
